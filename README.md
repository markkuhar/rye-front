## What is Rye language

Rye is a high level, dynamic **programming language** based on ideas from **Rebol**, flavored by
Factor, Linux shells and Golang. It's still an experiment in language design, but it should slowly become more and
more useful in real world.

It features a Golang based interpreter and console and could also be seen as (modest) **Go's scripting companion** as
Go's libraries are quite easy to integrate, and Rye can be embedded into Go programs as a scripting or config language.

I believe that as language becomes higher level it starts touching the user interface boundary, besides being a language
we have great emphasis on **interactive use** (Rye shell) where we will explore that.

## What is Rye-Front

Rye-Front is an external extension of Rye language focused on frontend technologies like: GUI, Game engine, Graphics, Browsers ...

### Why a separate repository

 * So Rye remains lighter on dependencies, easier to build, focused on backend and interactive shell
 * So that "frontend" related development is separated from language development
 * So that we test and improve on how users of Rye can externally extend it, add their own (private) bindings and write their own Go (private) builtin functions for hot-code optimization
